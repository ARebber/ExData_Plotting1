#How I did the project

##Step 1: Getting the data
After downloading the zip file, I unpacked it in my R working directory folder, so that I had it as a .txt file there. 
From that point onwards, I start every R script obtaining the data from this .txt file. 
I chose to only load the required data and not the entire data first, followed by subsetting.
